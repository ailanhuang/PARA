# PARA
Welcome to PARA, a freee web server for predicting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist. 

β2 adrenergic receptor agonists as growth promoters in animal breeding is banned in China and Europe. However, current specific analytical methods are powerless for the detection of new type of β2 AR agonists. So PARA was developed, it is a classification model combining *molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling and machine learning methods*.
